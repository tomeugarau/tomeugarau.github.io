  abstract  = {In this project we study two different proofs of the Calderón-Zygmund estimates for the Poisson equation. Our first approach is that of Gilbarg and Trudinger, based on a real interpolation argument. We also explore the proof of Wang, with a geometric approach where the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function plays a crucial role. Moreover, as an application of the estimates,  we deduce the regularity of solutions to nonlinear elliptic equations. We also briefly review the known extensions of regularity theory to the nonlinear setting.}
