  abstract  = {Underwater image enhancement is key to fully comprehending the marine ecosystem. The low quality of such images makes their study difficult; thus, it is important to improve their quality. To study this as a mathematical problem, we study the existence of a unique solution and we develop primal-dual algorithms to find the approximate solution. In order to do so, we study the basic properties of Sobolev spaces, we introduce the direct method of the Calculus of Variations, and we use tools from Convex Optimisation to develop the algorithms to enhance underwater images.},
