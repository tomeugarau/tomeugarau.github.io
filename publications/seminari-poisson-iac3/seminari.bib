  abstract = "In this seminar, we review classical results related to second-order divergence form elliptic partial differential equations leading up to L^p regularity theory, with a particular focus on the Calder√≥n-Zygmund inequality. We will explore this result from two perspectives: with interpolation of Lebesgue spaces and with a geometric approach. We apply these results to study the regularity of nonlinear Poisson-type equations. Finally, we will provide a brief overview of the nonlinear regularity theory."
